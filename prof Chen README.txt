The SQL is all browser stuff so I'm just gonna point you towards my final project to see use of it.
I couldn't get her MongoDB module to work the way she wanted it, I had to use Mongosh which makes me think the lesson is outdated.

UPDATE: It is all depricated, her tutorial was last updated in 2018, I will make an attempt to do the blog website challenge next week
but it is not my priority since it isn't really my fault that this tutorial is depricated. If I have time I will also update her restfull
api module which I placed in here. Anyways I'm gonna watch the rest and authentication modules anyways because they still have good 
concepts which will help me make one that actually works in the future. Your regularlly scheduled web course will continue with reactjs.
