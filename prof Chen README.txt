The SQL is all browser stuff so I'm just gonna point you towards my final project to see use of it.
I couldn't get her MongoDB module to work the way she wanted it, I had to use Mongosh and use different commands 
which makes me think the lesson is outdated.

UPDATE: It is all depricated (the mongodb), her tutorial was last updated in 2018.
I will make an attempt to do fix them but it is not my priority since it isn't really my fault that this 
tutorial is depricated. 
Anyways I'm gonna watch the rest and authentication modules anyways because they still have good concepts which will help me make one 
that actually works when I update her code. 
Your regularly scheduled web course will continue with reactjs.
Also you might want to get a new tutorial for the mongodb stuff for next semester, if I find anything I'll add it here.
